Controlling the Onboard LED on ESP8266: A Step-by-Step Guide

This guide outlines how to control the onboard LED of an ESP8266 (e.g., NodeMCU) to blink every second using Arduino IDE 

Prerequisites

Hardware: ESP8266 (e.g., NodeMCU), USB cable(type-b for this case), computer.
Software: Arduino IDE
Setup: ESP8266 board support and USB drivers installed.

Steps

1. Install Arduino IDE: Download from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. Add ESP8266 Support: In Arduino IDE, add `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json` in 
Preferences > Additional Boards Manager URLs, 
then install "esp8266" in Boards Manager Select your board (e.g., NodeMCU 1.0).

3. Connect ESP8266: Plug the ESP8266 into your computer via USB.
goto Device manager from windows search option select Ports(COM port) and see where the esp8266 is allocated then Select the correct port in Tools > Port.

4. Write Sketch: Use this code to blink the onboard LED (D4 for NodeMCU):
 
   void setup() {
     pinMode(D4, OUTPUT);
   }
   void loop() {
     digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);  // Onboard LED is active LOW
     delay(1000);
     digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
     delay(1000);
   }
   Save as `ESP8266_OnboardLEDBlink.ino`.
5. Upload Sketch: Click Upload in Arduino IDE. The onboard LED should blink every second.
